# PHZ Full Stack Standard Documentation V1.0.4

## 1. Project Description

- Business college Helsinki Fullstack Web Developer program's group project for PHZ Fullstack.

- Net promoter score (NPS) is a widely used market research metric that typically takes the form of a single survey question asking respondents to rate the likelihood that they would recommend a company, product, or a service to a friend or colleague. NPS score is measured between 0 and 10. The NPS assumes a subdivision of respondents into "promoters" who provide ratings of 9 or 10, "passives" who provide ratings of 7 or 8, and "detractors" who provide ratings of 6 or lower. In this project we created an embeddable questionnaire form for PHZ Full Stack to measure their companys NPS.

### 1.1. Business Vision

- To create simple, clear and easy to use dashboard for the HR-personel to monitor the NPS score.

### 1.2. Task Management

### 1.4. Use Cases

- Customer feedback is taken via a form where a simple question is asked. Customer will select a score depending upon their view and enter some comments. Comments are not obligatory. With the responses the percentage of Promoters, Detractors and Passifiers is shown on the dashboard. Net Promoter Score is calculated with the percentages. With the dashboard the HR-personel is able to see the monthly changes in NPS scores and feedback responses.

- By default the dashboard shows the last 6 months data.

- 'Net Promoter Score' is used to measure the satisfaction of the employees which helps to get an idea to improve their workplace satisfaction.
